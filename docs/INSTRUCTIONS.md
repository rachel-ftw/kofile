# Instructions

## Objective

You've been given a JSON API that contains a list of movies Evan likes and a bare-bones website to present the data. The website currently looks like this:

You've been tasked with delivering the following requirements so as to make the information in the provided API consumable by individuals other than Evan.

## Requirements

1. Display the list of movies on the page. Movies should be listed in alphabetical order.

    ![display titles](http://i.imgur.com/y9uwdQw.png)

1. When a user clicks on the title of the movie, they should be redirected to the Rotten Tomatoes page for that movie.

1. Display the year the movie was released next to the title.

1. Display the Rotten Tomatoes rating next to each movie title in the list. This value should be displayed as a percentage.

1. In order to not spam our API, cache the responses in the browsers [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API). Do not make network requests to the API if there is a cached version of the response available.

1. Allow searching by title. Only filter results if 2 or more characters are entered in the search box. The list below should update when the value of the search box changes.

    Search should

    - be case-insensitive
    - exact match on any substring in `title`

1. Allow filtering by decade. Decade options should be computed from the data, *not hard-coded*. Selecting a decade should filter the list to show all movies from that decade.

    **NOTE**: This filter should be additive to the title search box above it.

1. When a movie row is clicked, expand the row to show what Evan says about the movie. Clicking the row again should collapse it.

    **NOTE**: Clicking on the title should still take you to the Rotten Tomatoes page, but ***should not*** expand the row before the user leaves the page.

1. Display the movie art next to the review. The image files are provided by the API.

1. All of the above features should look nice. Feel free to borrow styling from the screenshots or improve upon them. Do not worry about cross-browser compatibility; the only browser you need to concern yourself with is the latest version of Google Chrome.

## Resources Provided

You've been given a working [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) setup, a basic application structure, and a JSON API.

You can accomplish all of the above with just `React`â€”no need to bring in any other libraries.

## Success Criteria

1. Your solution delivers all the requirements above.
1. Your code is thoughtful, stylistically consistent, and easily extensible.
1. You submit your solution within 24-48 hours of receiving this assignment.

This list is not exhaustive, but it represents the bulk of what comprises a successful solution.
